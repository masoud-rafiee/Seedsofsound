        <h2>Background &amp; Context</h2>
        <p>
          Food is a universal connector, yet young people frequently feel
          disconnected from the policies and systems that dictate what ends up
          on their plates. Around the world, youth experience disengagement,
          eco‑anxiety and a lack of opportunities to shape the future they
          will inherit. <em>The&nbsp;First&nbsp;Supper</em> responds to this
          urgency by bringing together art, storytelling and participatory
          practices to amplify youth voices in conversations about food
          futures.
        </p>
        <p>
          Created through a transdisciplinary collaboration between students
          and faculty in sustainable agriculture and food systems, arts
          administration, drama and psychology at Bishop’s University, the
          project bridges science and culture. It invites audiences to
          envision sustainable and inclusive pathways forward—because
          imagining tomorrow’s food systems requires both data and
          imagination.

              <h3>The Table of the Future</h3>
              <p>
                At the heart of the exhibition is an interactive table set in
                the year 2050. Through speculative design and tactile
                prompts, visitors are invited to reimagine what dining could
                look like when sustainability, equity and community are
                prioritized.

              <p>
                A reimagined rotary phone invites participants to pick up and
                listen to excerpts from a growing audio archive. Voices from
                agroecological farmers, students and community members offer
                insights about food and culture in both English and French.

              <p>
                Young visitors can pledge an action that brings their vision of
                2050 closer to reality. These commitments form a living
                archive of possible futures, and a reminder email in 2029
                encourages participants to honour their pledge.

                An artisanal book made from seed‑infused paper invites
                handwritten promises for better futures. Once the exhibition
                closes, the pages can be planted to sprout real plants—
                transforming words into biological growth.
