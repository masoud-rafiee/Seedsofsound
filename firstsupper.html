          An interactive framework blending art, science and dialogue to
          reimagine the future of food.

        <h2 class="section-title">Background &amp; Context</h2>
        <p>
          The future of our food systems will be shaped by today’s youth,
          yet young people often face profound challenges engaging with
          this future. Around the world, they experience disengagement,
          eco‑anxiety, and lack of opportunities as they confront climate
          disruption, biodiversity loss and social inequalities. Despite
          having a central stake, their voices are rarely heard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The First Supper responds to this urgency by using art,
          storytelling and participatory practices to engage diverse
          audiences, support dialogue across communities and spark
          collective imagination about sustainable food futures. Developed
          at Bishop’s University through a transdisciplinary collaboration
          across Sustainable Agriculture, Arts Administration, Drama and
          Psychology, it bridges science and culture to envision inclusive
          pathways forward.

        <h2 class="section-title">Exhibition &amp; Engagement</h2>
        <p>
          The First Supper is an interactive booth envisioning food
          futures in 2050 through “The Table of the Future.” Visitors
          encounter artworks, speculative design and participatory tools
          that encourage them to connect with food as culture, justice and
          climate action. During the World Food Forum, youth are invited
          to co‑create the future rather than remain passive spectators.
        </p>
        <p>
          Seeds of Sound forms one of the booth’s interactive artworks.
          Participants lift a handset to hear voices and stories about
          food, culture and farming. This mosaic of perspectives grounds
          the exhibition in collective memory, reminding us that our
          futures are rooted in shared experiences and diversity.
