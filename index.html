          <h2>About the Project</h2>
          <p>
            The Seeds of Sound project transforms a vintage rotary telephone
            into an evocative audio installation. When you lift the receiver,
            it randomly plays recorded voices of students, athletes, farmers
            and dreamers, offering a mosaic of reflections on food, memory
            and the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            Powered by a RaspberryÂ Pi hidden inside the phone, the system
            plays highâ€‘quality audio and stops on hangâ€‘up, readying a new
            track for the next listener. The tactile experience of holding
            an analogue handset bridges past and future, while the content
            fosters dialogue and reflection.

          <h3>Random Playback</h3>
          <p>
            Every time you pick up the handset, you hear a different voice
            from our curated archive. The RaspberryÂ Pi selects recordings at
            random and resets when the phone is hung up.

          <h3>Highâ€‘Fidelity Sound</h3>
          <p>
            Our custom circuit uses a highâ€‘quality DAC and amplifier to
            drive the vintage handset speaker with CDâ€‘quality audio. Voices
            are crisp and engaging, even in noisy settings.

        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h3>Sustainable Storytelling</h3>
          <p>
            Paired with an artisanal book made from seedâ€‘paper, participants
            can write their reflections by hand. Later, those pages can be
            planted, turning words into wildflowers.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="feature-card">
          <h3>Accessible & Robust</h3>
          <p>
            The electronics are neatly integrated inside the phone, ensuring
            reliability during multiâ€‘day exhibitions. A discreet hook switch
            senses when the handset is lifted and stops playback when
            returned.

        <h2>Support Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          ðŸ’¡ Why Your Support Matters
            Your support helps us sustain and scale Seeds of Sound â€” an installation that transforms vintage telephones into living archives of voices, memories, and ideas.
            But this is only the beginning. The same team is actively prototyping IoT systems, AI tools, robotics, solar technologies, and brainâ€“computer interfaces. Backing this initiative means fueling a pipeline of breakthrough projects that merge creativity with engineering and sustainability.
            Together, we can:
            Bring these technologies to new audiences â€” from local communities to global forums.
            Expand our archive of voices, making innovation participatory and human-centered.
            Build partnerships with accelerators, incubators, companies, and research labs who are ready to collaborate on the next frontier.
            By joining us, you donâ€™t just support an art piece â€” you invest in a new generation of innovators who are bridging science, design, and social impact.
